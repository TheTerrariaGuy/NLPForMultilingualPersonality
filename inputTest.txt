Hey, 你昨天的考试怎么样? 哎, don’t even talk about it. It was so hard! 老师出的题比我想象的难多了. I know, right? 我本来以为会简单一点, but then I saw the first question and just—完了. Same! And the essay part? 完全不知道怎么写, I just wrote whatever came to mind. Me too, but 老师真的很严格, so I don’t know if it’s enough. Yeah… 下次我们还是早点复习吧, I don’t want to go through this stress again. Agreed. 下周开始一起复习吧? 好啊, let’s do that!
